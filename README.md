### Summary
This iOS application is built using SwiftUI and follows MVVM architecture to display recipes from an API. The app features:

- A clean, scrollable list of recipes with thumbnails
- Detailed recipe view with large images
- YouTube video integration for recipes with video content
- Web view integration for recipe sources
- Support for both light and dark modes
- Pull-to-refresh functionality
- Error handling with user-friendly messages

### Focus Areas
1. **Architecture and Code Quality**
   - Implemented MVVM pattern for clear separation of concerns
   - Created comprehensive unit tests for all major components
   - Used protocol-based design for better testability and modularity

2. **User Experience**
   - Implemented async image loading with loading indicators
   - Added pull-to-refresh for content updates
   - Created smooth navigation transitions
   - Included error handling with user-friendly messages

3. **Performance**
   - Implemented image caching system
   - Used async/await for network operations
   - Optimized memory usage with proper view lifecycle management

### Time Spent
Based on the file creation timestamps and complexity, estimated time spent: 8 hours

### Trade-offs and Decisions
1. **Image Caching**
   - Chose in-memory caching over disk caching for simplicity
   - Trade-off: Higher memory usage vs. implementation time

2. **Web Content**
   - Used WKWebView for recipe sources instead of parsing content
   - Trade-off: Less control over content display vs. broader compatibility

3. **Testing Approach**
   - Focused on unit tests over UI tests
   - Trade-off: Better coverage of business logic vs. user interaction testing

### Weakest Part of the Project
The YouTube video integration could be improved:
- Currently uses basic WebView implementation
- Could benefit from native YouTube API integration
- Lacks video playback controls and offline support
- No video thumbnail previews

### Additional Information
1. **Dependencies**
   - No external dependencies used, keeping the project lightweight and maintainable

2. **Minimum iOS Version**
   - Set to iOS 18.0 to leverage latest SwiftUI features
   - Could be lowered if broader device support is needed

3. **Future Improvements**
   - Add recipe search functionality
   - Implement favorites/bookmarking
   - Add offline support
   - Enhance accessibility features
